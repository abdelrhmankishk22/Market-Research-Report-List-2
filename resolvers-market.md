<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resolvers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brushless Resolvers</li><li>Brushed Resolvers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Resolvers are a type of position sensor used to detect the angular position of a rotating shaft. There are two main market types of resolvers: Brushless Resolvers and Brushed Resolvers. Brushless resolvers utilize electronic commutation, eliminating the need for brushes and resulting in improved reliability and durability. They are commonly used in high-performance applications where accuracy and precision are crucial, such as aerospace and defense industries. On the other hand, brushed resolvers still use brushes to transfer electrical signals, making them less reliable and more prone to wear and tear. These are often used in less demanding applications such as industrial automation.</p></p>
