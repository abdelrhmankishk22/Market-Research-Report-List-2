<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membranes for Water Electrolysis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proton Exchange Membranes</li><li>Ion Exchange Membranes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The membranes used in water electrolysis market can be divided into two types: Proton Exchange Membranes (PEMs) and Ion Exchange Membranes. PEMs function by allowing protons to pass through while blocking the flow of electrons, enabling the separation of hydrogen and oxygen gases during electrolysis. They are commonly used in low-temperature electrolysis systems. On the other hand, Ion Exchange Membranes possess a higher ion conductivity, allowing for the transportation of both cations and anions. These membranes are typically utilized in high-temperature electrolysis systems. Both types play a crucial role in enabling efficient water electrolysis processes.</p></p>
