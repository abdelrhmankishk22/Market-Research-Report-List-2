<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Marine VHF Radio Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Built-in DSC Type</li><li>Common Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The handheld marine VHF radio market consists of two main types: built-in DSC type and common type. The built-in DSC (Digital Selective Calling) type radios are equipped with a distress button that can transmit an automated distress signal with the vessel's position, making it suitable for emergency situations. On the other hand, the common type radios lack this distress feature and are used for general communication purposes among vessels, making them more economical and suitable for regular use. Both types serve the purpose of communication, but their features and applications differ.</p></p>
